    categories: ["comp-mech", "num-methods"],
    status: "used",
    level: "intermediate",
    short: "a numerical method that approximates continuous physical systems by breaking them into smaller, simpler pieces called elements.",
    definition: "the finite element method is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to boundary value problems for partial differential equations. instead of trying to solve the governing equations over an entire continuous domain at once, the domain is discretized into a finite number of smaller subdomains (elements) connected at nodes.",
    intuition: "imagine trying to predict how a complex bridge will bend under load. solving the continuous equations directly is almost impossible for arbitrary geometry. fem chops the bridge into thousands of simple triangles or tetrahedra, writes a simple algebraic approximation on each piece, then stitches all those little equations together into one big sparse system that a computer can actually solve.",
    equations: [
      { label: "global system", tex: "K u = f" },
      { label: "where", note: "K = global stiffness matrix, u = unknown displacement vector, f = applied force vector" }
    ],
    why: "almost every modern structural analysis, heat transfer, and multiphysics simulation is built on some form of fem. it is the bridge between continuum mechanics theory and practical engineering numbers.",
    inWork: "fem is the mathematical backbone of both the fea playground 2d and the fea generative cto engine. every compliance calculation, every sensitivity field, and every mesh convergence check ultimately reduces to assembling and solving Ku = f.",

    categories: ["comp-mech"],
    status: "used",
    level: "intermediate",
    short: "the practical application of the finite element method to predict structural, thermal, or multiphysics behavior of engineered components.",
    definition: "fea is the engineering practice of using the finite element method to analyze how a part or assembly will respond to loads, constraints, temperature, etc. it includes meshing, applying boundary conditions, solving the discrete system, and post-processing stresses, strains, and displacements.",
    intuition: "fem is the math. fea is the whole workflow you actually run: import geometry → mesh it → slap boundary conditions on → hit solve → look at stress plots and decide whether the design is safe.",
    why: "it lets you catch structural problems before you print or machine anything. it is also the foundation for topology optimization and generative design.",
    inWork: "both the fea playground and the generative cto engine are pure fea tools. the lab journal entries on mesh convergence, sparse assembly, and stress recovery are all fea validation work.",

    short: "the discrete geometric representation of a continuous domain, made of nodes and elements.",
    definition: "a mesh is a collection of nodes (points) and elements (lines, triangles, tetrahedra, etc.) that approximate a continuous geometry so that numerical methods can be applied.",
    intuition: "think of it as a wireframe or a grid laid over the part. the finer the mesh, the closer the discrete model gets to the real continuous object — but also the more degrees of freedom you have to solve.",
    why: "mesh quality and density directly control both accuracy and computational cost. a bad mesh can produce completely wrong stresses even if the solver is perfect.",
    inWork: "mesh generation and refinement show up constantly in the lab journal — especially the memory-spike abort when the 2r robot meshes got too fine and the browser heap limit experiments in the fea playground.",

    status: "used",
    level: "intermediate",
    short: "the process of refining a mesh until the solution stops changing meaningfully, proving that discretization error is under control.",
    definition: "mesh convergence studies systematically increase mesh density (or decrease element size) and monitor a quantity of interest (displacement, stress, frequency, etc.). when further refinement produces negligible change, the solution is considered mesh-converged.",
    intuition: "if you keep cutting the elements in half and the max stress only moves by 0.3 %, you can finally trust the number. if it jumps 15 % every time you refine, you are still looking at discretization error, not physics.",
    why: "without convergence evidence, any stress or displacement plot is just a pretty picture with unknown accuracy.",
    inWork: "the lab journal entry from 2026-08-09 records an aborted mesh convergence study on the 2r planar robot that ran out of memory. that failure directly drove the switch to selective refinement and out-of-core ideas.",

    definition: "the stiffness matrix K maps a vector of nodal displacements u to the corresponding vector of nodal forces f via Ku = f. for linear elasticity it is symmetric and positive-definite (after boundary conditions are applied).",
    intuition: "each column of K tells you what force pattern you need to apply to produce a unit displacement at one particular degree of freedom while holding all others fixed. it is the discrete version of the continuous elasticity operator.",

    why: "assembling and solving the global stiffness system is the core computational step of almost every linear structural analysis.",
    inWork: "the custom c++ coo→csr converter and the pure-js assembler in the fea playground both exist solely to build and solve stiffness matrices efficiently. the 2026-04-27 journal entry documents an off-by-one bug in the sparse format that was caught by a patch-test unit test.",

    status: "used",
    level: "intermediate",
    short: "a matrix in which most entries are zero, stored and operated on using specialized formats that skip the zeros.",
    definition: "sparse matrices arise naturally in finite-element and finite-difference discretizations because each node only interacts with its immediate neighbors. formats such as coo, csr, and csc store only the nonzero values plus index information.",
    intuition: "a 50 000-dof stiffness matrix is theoretically 50k × 50k = 2.5 billion entries. in practice it has maybe 15–20 nonzeros per row. storing the zeros would waste gigabytes and make every multiply 1000× slower.",
    why: "without sparse linear algebra, industrial-scale fea would be impossible on any machine that exists today.",
    inWork: "the fea generative engine uses scipy sparse matrices. the pure-js playground had to stream the stiffness matrix in blocks and move assembly into a web worker precisely because dense storage was not an option.",

    status: "used",
    level: "foundational",
    short: "a constraint or load applied on the boundary of the domain that makes the problem well-posed.",
    definition: "boundary conditions specify either the value of the primary variable (dirichlet) or the value of the flux / traction (neumann) on parts of the domain boundary. without them the discrete system is singular.",
    intuition: "a free-floating structure has rigid-body modes. fixing a few nodes (dirichlet) or applying known forces (neumann) removes those modes and lets the solver produce a unique solution.",
    why: "incorrect or incomplete boundary conditions are one of the most common sources of nonsense results in fea.",
    inWork: "every analysis in the playground and the generative engine starts by applying supports and loads. the journal frequently mentions how changing boundary conditions completely changes the optimal topology.",

    short: "the independent coordinates needed to completely describe the configuration of a system.",
    definition: "in structural mechanics each free nodal displacement or rotation is a degree of freedom. in robotics the joint angles (or prismatic displacements) are the dofs of the manipulator.",
    intuition: "a 2d truss node has 2 translational dofs. a 3d solid node has 3. a 2r planar arm has exactly 2 joint dofs. the size of the global stiffness matrix is equal to the number of free dofs.",
    why: "dof count is the primary driver of both computational cost and the complexity of the kinematic or dynamic equations.",
    inWork: "the 2r robot is deliberately a 2-dof system so the inverse-kinematics and jacobian analysis stay analytically tractable. the vehicle dynamics sim is a 14-dof model — that is why it needs careful integration and parallelization.",

    status: "used",
    level: "advanced",
    short: "a computational method that redistributes material inside a design domain to maximize performance under given constraints.",
    definition: "topology optimization finds the optimal material layout within a prescribed design domain by treating the material density (or presence/absence) at every point as a design variable. the most common formulation minimizes compliance subject to a volume fraction constraint.",
    intuition: "instead of starting with a solid block and carving material away by hand, you tell the computer the loads, the supports, and how much material you are allowed to use. it then grows the load paths that actually carry force and deletes everything else, often producing organic, bone-like structures.",
    why: "it is the mathematical engine behind generative design and the reason aerospace brackets and automotive parts look the way they do today.",
    inWork: "the fea generative cto engine is a pure topology-optimization code. the entire lab-journal series on volume-fraction sweeps, density filters, heaviside projection, and manufacturing constraints exists because of this project.",
    related: ["simp", "compliance", "volume-fraction", "sensitivity-filtering", "heaviside-projection"]
  },
  {
    id: "simp",
    term: "SIMP",
    categories: ["topo-opt"],
    status: "used",
    level: "advanced",
    short: "solid isotropic material with penalization — the most widely used material interpolation scheme in density-based topology optimization.",
    definition: "simp interpolates the young’s modulus of an element as E(ρ) = E₀ ρ^p where ρ ∈ [0,1] is the density design variable and p ≥ 3 is the penalization exponent. intermediate densities are made inefficient, driving the optimizer toward a crisp 0-1 design.",
    intuition: "if you leave the exponent at 1, the optimizer is happy to keep lots of gray (half-density) material. raising the power makes gray material artificially weak, so the algorithm prefers pure solid or pure void.",
    equations: [
      { label: "material interpolation", tex: "E(\\rho) = E_0 \\rho^p" },
      { label: "typical range", note: "p = 3 is the classic starting value; continuation on p is often used" }
    ],
    why: "without penalization the optimizer produces unprintable intermediate-density regions. simp is the simplest practical way to push the solution toward manufacturable black-and-white designs.",
    inWork: "every volume-fraction sweep recorded in the journal (2026-08-14 and earlier) uses simp. the notes on gray-scale intermediate densities and the later push on projection β are direct consequences of the simp formulation.",

    id: "compliance",
    term: "compliance",
    categories: ["topo-opt", "comp-mech"],
    status: "used",
    level: "intermediate",
    short: "a scalar measure of structural flexibility; the work done by the applied loads (or equivalently uᵀKu).",
    definition: "in linear elasticity compliance is defined as C = fᵀu = uᵀKu. minimizing compliance is equivalent to maximizing global stiffness for a given load case.",
    intuition: "low compliance means the structure barely moves under the design loads. high compliance means it is floppy. topology optimization almost always starts by minimizing compliance.",
    why: "it is a smooth, differentiable objective that correlates well with many practical stiffness requirements and has an efficient adjoint sensitivity.",
    inWork: "the generative cto engine’s primary objective is compliance minimization. the journal repeatedly tracks how compliance changes with volume fraction and filter radius.",

    short: "the fraction of the design domain that is allowed to be solid material.",
    definition: "volume fraction V_f = (∫_Ω ρ dV) / |Ω| is the main resource constraint in density-based topology optimization. typical values range from 0.2 to 0.5 depending on the application.",
    intuition: "if you set V_f = 0.3 the optimizer is only allowed to keep 30 % of the material. it has to decide which 30 % actually carries load and delete the rest.",
    why: "it is the simplest and most important constraint that forces the optimizer to produce a meaningful lightweight design instead of just filling the entire domain with solid.",
    inWork: "the 2026-08-14 journal entry documents a full volume-fraction sweep from 0.2 to 0.55 on a cantilever. the 0.35 design produced the cleanest load path.",

    short: "a smooth approximation of the heaviside step function used to force intermediate densities toward 0 or 1 after filtering.",
    definition: "after the density filter, a projection ρ̃ = H(ρ̄, β, η) is applied. as the continuation parameter β → ∞ the projection approaches a sharp step at the threshold η, producing nearly discrete designs.",
    intuition: "the filter alone still leaves a band of gray. the heaviside projection is the final “make it black or white” step that improves manufacturability.",
    why: "it dramatically reduces intermediate densities while still allowing gradient-based optimization through a smooth approximation.",
    inWork: "the journal notes that gray-scale was still present at r_min = 1.5 and that the next planned run would push projection β higher. volume drift after projection is also discussed as an open question.",

    id: "density-filter",

    level: "intermediate",
    short: "a convolution operation that smooths the density field over a characteristic length scale, eliminating checkerboarding and imposing a minimum length scale.",
    definition: "the filtered density at a point is a weighted average of the design variables inside a circular (or spherical) neighborhood of radius r_min. the filter is usually linear and density-based.",
    intuition: "without a filter the optimizer loves to create alternating solid-void checkerboard patterns that are numerically stiff but physically meaningless and unprintable. the filter forces neighboring elements to have similar densities.",
    why: "it is the standard cure for checkerboarding and the simplest way to control minimum member size.",
    inWork: "filter radius is a recurring parameter in the journal. the morphological-closing experiments for manufacturing constraints are built on top of the same length-scale idea.",

    definition: "for a robot with joint configuration q and end-effector pose x(q), the jacobian is J(q) = ∂x/∂q. it provides the linear map ẋ = J(q) q̇ between joint space and task space velocities.",
    intuition: "it answers the question: if i nudge each joint by a tiny amount, which way and how fast does the end effector move? when the jacobian loses rank, some directions of end-effector motion become impossible — those are the singularities.",

    inWork: "the 2r planar robot inverse-kinematics system uses the analytical jacobian. near the workspace boundary the determinant approached zero and the numerical solver started oscillating between elbow configurations. a soft barrier plus hysteresis and later damped least-squares (λ = 0.02) were added to keep the solution stable.",

    definition: "given a desired end-effector position (and possibly orientation) x_d, inverse kinematics solves for a joint configuration q such that the forward map f(q) = x_d. analytical solutions exist for simple geometries; numerical methods are required for more complex arms.",
    intuition: "forward kinematics is easy: you turn the joints and the math tells you where the tip is. inverse kinematics is the harder reverse question — “i want the tip here, what joint angles get me there?”",
    why: "almost every real robot task is specified in cartesian space (pick that object, follow this path). the controller ultimately needs joint commands, so ik is unavoidable.",

    why: "it is the foundation for both visualization and for setting up the inverse problem. every jacobian is derived from the forward map.",

    intuition: "when a 2r arm is fully stretched out, the two links are collinear. no amount of joint motion can produce a force or velocity along the line of the arm — that direction is lost. that is a singularity.",

    definition: "instead of the pure pseudoinverse solution Δq = J⁺ Δx, damped least squares solves Δq = Jᵀ (J Jᵀ + λ² I)⁻¹ Δx. the damping factor λ prevents the solution from exploding when the smallest singular value of J approaches zero.",
    intuition: "near a singularity the pure inverse tries to command huge joint velocities to produce a tiny cartesian move. damping tells the solver “prefer smaller joint motions even if the cartesian error is not driven all the way to zero.”",

    definition: "percent overshoot is (peak value − steady value) / steady value × 100 %. it is a direct measure of how aggressive the transient response is.",
    intuition: "too much proportional or too little derivative gain and the arm flies past the target angle before settling. that overshoot can cause collisions or excite unmodeled resonances.",

    definition: "for a unity-feedback system the steady-state error depends on the open-loop type and the form of the reference (step, ramp, etc.). integral action is the classic way to drive step-error to zero.",
    intuition: "the arm gets close to the target angle but sits a fraction of a degree off forever. that leftover offset is steady-state error — often caused by gravity, friction, or insufficient integral gain.",
    why: "many tasks (holding a precise pose, tracking a slow trajectory) care more about final accuracy than about how fast the system arrived.",
    inWork: "the 2r shoulder still showed a ~0.7° residual that scaled with cos(θ). a static gravity compensation term using measured link masses removed most of it; the rest was attributed to cable stretch and gearbox compliance.",
